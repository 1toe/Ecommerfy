    You are an expert in Ionic, React, and Firebase Firestore.

    Project Structure and File Naming
    - Organize by feature directories (e.g., 'services/', 'components/', 'pipes/')
  
    ## Project Structure and Organization
    - Use descriptive names for variables and functions (e.g 'getUsers', 'calculateTotalPrice').
    - Avoid global state when possible.
    - Manage routing through a dedicated module
    - Centralize API calls and error handling through services
    - Manage all storage through single point of entry and retrievals. Also put storage keys at single to check and find.
    - Create dedicated Firebase services for each collection type
    - Implement Firebase error handling in a centralized service
    - Use Firebase transactions for data consistency
    - Use Firebase rules for data security
    - Use Firebase functions for serverless backend logic
    - Use Firebase storage for file uploads and downloads
    - Use Firebase authentication for user management
    - Use Firebase analytics for tracking user behavior
    - Use Firebase crash reporting for error tracking
    - Structure Firestore queries for optimal performance
    
    ## Naming Conventions
    - camelCase: functions, variables (e.g., `getUsers`, `totalPrice`)
    - kebab-case: file names (e.g., `user-service.ts`, `home-component.ts`)
    - PascalCase: classes (e.g., `UserService`)
    - Booleans: use prefixes like 'should', 'has', 'is' (e.g., `shouldLoadData`, `isLoading`).
    - UPPERCASE: constants and global variables (e.g., `API_URL`, `APP_VERSION`).
    - Firestore collections: plural nouns (e.g., `users`, `bookings`).
    - Firestore documents: descriptive IDs (e.g., `user-${uid}`, `booking-${timestamp}`).
    - ANY COMENTS needs to be IN SPANISH!.
    
    ## UI and Styles
    - Prefer Ionic components.
    - Create reusable components for complex UI.
    - Use CSS for styling.
    - Centralize themes, colors, and fonts.
    - Implement loading states for Firebase operations.
    - Handle Firebase offline data gracefully.
    - Show appropriate error messages for Firebase operations.
    - Implement real-time UI updates with Firebase snapshots.

    ## Performance and Optimization
    - Implement lazy loading.
    - Use pre-fetching for critical data.
    - Use caching for all the data that is needed multiple times.
    - Use global error and alert handlers.
    - Integrate any crash reporting service for the application.
    - Use a centralised alert handler to handle all the alert in the application.
    - Implement Firebase offline persistence.
    - Use Firebase query cursors for pagination.
    - Optimize Firestore reads with proper indexing.
    - Cache Firestore query results.
    - Use Firestore batch operations for bulk updates.
    - Monitor Firestore quota usage.
